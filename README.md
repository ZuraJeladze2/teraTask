# Tera Bank User Management Dashboard 
ðŸ«¡ Welcome to the Tera Bank User Management Dashboard! This Angular application is designed to manage user profiles with different roles, providing features such as authorization, profile editing and user listing.
Built with:
* Angular v17 ðŸ”¥
* RxJS ðŸ”¥
* Angular lazy loading Routes ðŸ”¥
* Angular Material ðŸ”¥
* and Reactive Forms ðŸ”¥
  
ðŸš€ this dashboard offers a modern and efficient user interface. It features a simple and clean design aimed at providing a user-friendly experience. The emphasis is on simplicity and clarity, with a minimalist approach to design elements. This ensures ease of use and reduces cognitive load for users interacting with the application. The code is written with best practices (I hope ðŸ˜¹) using RxJS superpowers for state management and data streaming through the application. Streams are well controlled / optimized and not overused, thanks to RxJS operators.


## How to run

First of all, traditionally run `npm i` to install node modules.
Also you have to make sure you have json-server installed on your machine, if not, run `npm i json-server`.
Okay now we are ready to run our (I mean my) app:

1. open terminal and run `npm run teraApp` to run the json-server
2. open new terminal and run `ng serve` to run the app.

### That's it, congratulations!

I hope you'll like it because I'm not having a good night sleep for 6 days straight ðŸ˜¹
